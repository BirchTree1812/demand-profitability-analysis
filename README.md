# Demand and Profitability Analysis for a Multi-Product Category

As a marketing analytic consultant, you are tasked with performing pricing and profitability analysis for a multi-product category with three products sold by different firms.

The demand system equation is as follows:

$$ A_1 \cdot P_1^{-1} + A_2 \cdot P_2^{-1} + A_3 \cdot P_3^{-1} = 1 $$

Where:
- $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are the prices of the three products
- $A_1, A_2, A_3$ are constants that represent the demand elasticity for each product

The base prices for the products are as follows:
- Product 1: $100
- Product 2: $150
- Product 3: $200

Your analysis should include the following:
1. Calculate the demand elasticity for each product
2. Determine the optimal prices for each product to maximize profitability
3. Analyze the impact of price changes on overall demand and profitability
