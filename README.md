Overview
You are a marketing analytic consultant doing category analysis for a multi-product
category. You are asked to perform pricing and proﬁtability analysis for this category. The
market has three products sold by di erent ﬁrms: 1, 2, and 3. You have been informed that
the marginal cost of the products are C1 = 0.5, C2 = 0.75, C3 = 0.9, and the retail margin for
all the products is 10%. Denote the prices of the three products as P1, P2, P3. Based on the
demand models that your data science team has run on the sales and pricing data for this
category, you know that the own and cross price elasticities for the three products can be
speciﬁed using the following demand system:
𝑄 =𝐴 𝑃 . 𝑃 . 𝑃 .
𝑄 =𝐴 𝑃 . 𝑃 . 𝑃 .
𝑄 =𝐴 𝑃 . 𝑃 . 𝑃 .
Further, the base prices of three products are given as: P1 = $2, P2 = $1.75 and P3 = $1.5.
Please answer the following questions based on this information. (Note: You are not given
